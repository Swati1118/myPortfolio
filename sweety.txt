Modifiers in java:

Modifiers are Keywords that are added to change meaning of a defination. In java, modifiers are categorized into two types,
1.Access Control modifier.
2.Non Access modifier.



1.Access control modifier.....
             Java Language has four access modifier to control access levels for classes,variable methods and constructor.

              * Default :- Default has scope  only inside same pacakage.
              * Public :-  Public scope is visible everywhere
             * Protected :- Protected has scope within the package and all sub classes
              * Private :-  Private has scope only within the classes               
               
      
2) Non-Access Modifier
    Non -access modifiers do not change the accessbility of variables and methhods, but they do proide them special properties.
    Non-access modifiers are of 5 types,
    1. Final
    2.Static.
    3.Transient.
    4.Synchronized.
    5.Volatile

1.Final

 The final keyword in java is used to restric the user. The java final keyword can be used in many context. Final can be:
 # Variable
# method
# class

2. Static
  
   static modifiers are used to create class variable and class methods which can be accessed without instance of a class .


Static with variables:--
    static variables are defined as a class members that can be accessed without any object of that class.
    static varible has only one single storage .All the object of the class having static varible will have the same instatnce of static
    variable.static variables are initialized only once.

Static method:
  A method can be declared as static .static methods do not need instance ot its class for being accessed main() method is the most common 
 example of static method .main() method is declared as static because it is called before any object of the class is created.
 
Static block:-
  static block is used to initialize static data member.static block executes .




Synchronization:
           At times when more than one thread try to access a shared resource , we need to ensure that resource will be used 
          by only one thread at a time .The process by which this is achived is called synchronization.
            Synchronizaton keyword in java create a block of code refered to as critical seection .
        Every java object with a critical ection of code gets a lock associated with the object to enter critical section a thread need to obtain 
the corresponding object lock.
     General syntax:_
                  synchronized (object)
{
//statement to be synchronized
}

Why we use Synchronization ?
If we do not use synchronization and let two or more threds access a shared resourse at the same time,it will lead to distored reults.

Synchronized keyword:
TO synchronize above program ,we must serialie access to the shared display() method ,making it available to only one thred at time. This is 
done by using keyword synchronied with display() method 
      
 Enumeration :
 Enumeratiion was   added to java language in JDK5 .Enumeration means a list of named constant .In java ,enumeration defines a class type .
An Enumeration defines a class type .An Enumeration can have constructor ,methods and instance variables.
It is created using  enum keyword .Each enumeration constant is public ,static and final by default .
Eevn though enumaration defines a class type and have constructors ,you do not instantiate an  enum using new .Enumeration variables 
are used and declard in much a same way as you do a primitive variable.
